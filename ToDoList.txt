# ToDo list for R presentations

### R/Finance tasks

- [ ] remove earl_vwap_scatter?

- [x] perform daily and 10-minute aggregations of vol, skew, and hurst

- [x] how do volatility, volume, illiquidity, skew, and hurst change intraday (intraday seasonality)?

- [ ] is market illiquidity a proxy for volatility? 

- [ ] does market illiquidity create trading opportunities? 
use intra-day data 
divide time series into periods of high and low liquidity, and study if momentum or skew have more forecasting power. 
do periods of high skew coincide with high present or future returns? 

- [ ] regression of momentum (autocorrelation) versus volatility
divide time series into periods of high and low volatility, and study if momentum is higher as well. 
study effect of changing the rolling window size.

- [ ] regression of returns versus skews 
divide time series into periods of high and low liquidity, and study if momentum or skew have more forecasting power. 
study effect of changing the rolling window size.

- [ ] add slide:
explain Hurst exponent
daily seasonality of Hurst exponent
regress daily volume versus volatility
show that volatility and volume are proportional, so illiquidity index is just proportional to square root of volatility

- [ ] add slide:
regress daily volume versus volatility
show that volatility and volume are proportional, so illiquidity index is just proportional to square root of volatility




- [ ] slide High Frequency OHLC Data:
OHLC data offers data compression
packages xts and quantmod
change code to lazy load

- [ ] slide Estimating Skew From OHLC Data:
rename to Estimating Skew From OHLC Data
emph skew-like

- [ ] slide Daily Volatility and Skew From OHLC Data:
remove colnames()
explain skew_ohlc()

- [ ] prove analytically that function skew_ohlc() is a skew estimator

- [ ] investigate relationship between skew and ohlc skew  
create matrix of synthetic time series with varying levels of skew. 
use Poisson distribution?
aggregate the synthetic data to OHLC. 
show that the output from function skew_ohlc() is proportional to the skew estimator. 

- [ ] add qmao functions: 
gaa() for "get, apply, assign"
gsa() stands for "get, subset, assign".
To, get data for some tickers, subset the data, and then assign into an environment
